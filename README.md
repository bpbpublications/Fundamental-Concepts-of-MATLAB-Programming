# Fundamental Concepts of MATLAB Programming

From Learning the Basics to Solving a Problem with MATLAB

This is the code repository for [Fundamental Concepts of MATLAB Programming](https://bpbonline.com/products/fundamental-concepts-of-matlab-programming?_pos=1&_sid=aa53d9600&_ss=r), published by BPB Publications. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the journey of this book

## About the Book
MATLAB has been an essential platform for data computation. There are various types of technologies that are going on, but it requires a tool for data handling. MATLAB provides better computing power for a massive amount of data.
 
This book will be your comprehensive guide to creating applications, simulation, computation measures. The book begins with an introduction MATLAB and quickly goes on to teach you the usage of MATLAB. After this, we will explore the various commands and essential concepts and topics about MATLAB. Moving forward, we'll explore importing and exporting data, handling data, and visualization of data through different ways to plot a graph. Towards the end, we will explore the basic algebraic functions used in MATLAB.
